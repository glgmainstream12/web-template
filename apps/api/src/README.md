## Key Components

### Controllers
Contains the request handlers that process incoming HTTP requests and send responses. Each controller typically corresponds to a specific resource or feature.

### Middlewares
Express middleware functions that handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

### Models
Database models and schemas that define the structure of your data and handle database interactions.

### Routers
API route definitions that map HTTP endpoints to their corresponding controller functions.

### Services
Business logic layer that handles complex operations and external service integrations.

### Utils
Reusable utility functions and helpers used throughout the application.

### Validators
Request validation schemas to ensure incoming data meets the required format and constraints.

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern
2. Keep controllers thin and move business logic to services
3. Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns
4. Implement proper error handling
5. Write tests for new features
6. Document API endpoints using JSDoc or similar tools
